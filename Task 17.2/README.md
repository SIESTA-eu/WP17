<div align="justify">This subfolder contains the codes for NER-based text anonymization experiments. To run the codes, the dependencies need to be installed using the "install.sh" bash file. Fourteen pretrained models have been used. They include:
* dslim/bert-base-NER
* dslim/bert-large-NER
- dbmdz/bert-base-cased-finetuned-conll03-english
- dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english
- elastic/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-conll03-english
- Davlan/xlm-roberta-base-ner-hrl
- xlm-roberta-large-finetuned-conll03-english
- Jean-Baptiste/roberta-large-ner-english
- Davlan/xlm-roberta-large-ner-hrl
- Davlan/bert-base-multilingual-cased-ner-hrl
- spacy/en_core_web_sm
- spacy/en_core_web_md
- spacy/en_core_web_lg
- spacy/en_core_web_trf

The individual pretrained models need to changed as desired. The entity categories in the pretrained models and the experimental dataset (CECILIA) have been unified. For information about and access to CECILIA dataset used, kindly consult this [page](https://gvis.unileon.es/datasets-cecilia-10c-900-ner/)</div>
